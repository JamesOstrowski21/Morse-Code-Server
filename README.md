# Morse-Code-Server

This program creates a server along with a client class. The client can be run multiple times and have multiple clients 
connected to the server. The client can then send the server a message either in engligh using all capitol letters orin morse
code. The server then automatically sends back the opposite type of what the client sends. If the client sends a message in morse
code the server with respond with that message in english. If the client sends a message in english the server will respond with 
that message in morse code.
